# Glowing-Apple-Logo
This code creates a webpage with a glowing Apple logo using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you hover your mouse over the logo, it temporarily disables and then re-enables a CSS animation named "glow," creating a glowing effect. The logo is styled and positioned on a black background.
